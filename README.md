## What's inside this repository?

1. `README.md`: A markdown file that explains the content of the repository.

2. `ch1.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook file containing all the relevant code and plot belonging to the challenge questions.

3. ``modules/``: A folder including 2 Python modules used to solve the exercises in `ch1.ipynb`. The files included are:

    - `__init__.py`: A *init* file that allows us to import the modules into our Jupyter Notebook.

    - `netconnect.py`: A Python file including a `RandomNet` class designed to build Erdös-Rényi Random Graphs and $r$-Regular Random Graphs along with methods to check graph connectivity.

    - `topology.py`: A Python file including a `response_time_func` function designed calculates the maximum response time of a distributed system and a `construct_jellyfish_topology` function designed to build a Jellyfish topology graph.

4. ``.gitignore``: A predetermined `.gitignore` file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a Python project.

5. `NBD-Challenge1.pdf`: A pdf file containing the final report of the challenge.

6. `plots/`: A folder containing all relevant plots.
